# MLIR

Task 1:
It defines a function `matmul` for matrix multiplication of tensors A and B, storing the result in tensor C. It ensures the matrices have valid dimensions using runtime checks. The code utilizes the Linalg dialect's `linalg.generic` operation, parallelizing and reducing dimensions, and specifies the matrix multiplication computation within its region. The conditional execution with `scf.if` ensures correctness based on runtime checks. Overall, the code performs a parallelized matrix multiplication with dynamic dimensions, offering flexibility for various matrix sizes and shapes, and produces a tensor representing the result.
