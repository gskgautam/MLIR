To generate LLVM IR from the MLIR code, you need to use MLIR's `mlir-translate` tool to convert MLIR to LLVM IR. Assuming you have MLIR and the necessary dependencies installed, you can use the following command:

mlir-translate -mlir-to-llvmir <your_mlir_file>.mlir > <output_ll_file>.ll


Replace `<your_mlir_file>.mlir` with the name of your MLIR file, and `<output_ll_file>.ll` with the desired name for the LLVM IR output file.

Note: Ensure that you have MLIR and LLVM tools installed, and adjust the paths accordingly if necessary.

Now, assuming your MLIR file is named `task2.mlir`, you would run:

mlir-translate -mlir-to-llvmir task2.mlir > task2.ll

This command will generate the LLVM IR in the `task2.ll` file. You can then inspect or further compile this LLVM IR using LLVM tools like `llc` or `clang`.
